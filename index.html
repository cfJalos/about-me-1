        <main>
            <p>My name is Christopher Quiocho. I am originally from Honolulu, HI and I currently reside in Seattle, WA. I moved to Washington for a great job opportunity at them time and also because I absolutely love to go camping during the summer and skiing in the winter. The Pacific Northwest is great for that!</p>

            <p>I was a Regional Talent and Business Development Manager for a well known hairdressing company for 9 years. I had the opportunity and pleasure of traveling and facilitating continuing education classes and training throughout the United States, Canada and Latin America.</p>

            <p>As far as education goes, I hold a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance Theatre. I am currently attending Code Fellows to pursue a Certificate in Software Development.</p>
